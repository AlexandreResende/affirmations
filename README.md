# Affirmations

A tiny api for fighting impostor syndrome and building example apps.

Inspired by the [dad jokes api](https://icanhazdadjoke.com) and the [Internet Chuck Norris Jokes api](http://www.icndb.com/api/). The world could always use more apis in the world for bringing joy.

## Usage

From the command line:
```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://www.affirmations.dev"
```
example response:
```
{"affirmation":"Sucking at something is the first step towards being good at something"}
```
